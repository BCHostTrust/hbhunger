About hunger
============
This mod adds a hunger mechanic to the game. Player actions like digging, placing and walking causes exhausion,
that lowers players saturation. Also every 800 seconds you lose 1 saturation point without doing anything.
If you are hungry (0 saturation) you will suffer damage and die in case you don't eat something.


Currently supported food:
-------------------------
- Apples (default)
- Animalmaterials (mobf modpack)
- Bread (default)
- Bushes
- bushes_classic
- Creatures
- Dwarves (beer and such)
- Docfarming
- Fishing
- Farming plus
- Farming (default and Tenplus1's fork)
- Food
- fruit
- Glooptest
- JKMod
- kpgmobs
- Mobfcooking
- Mooretrees
- Mtfoods
- mushroom
- mush45
- Seaplants (sea)
- Simple mobs

Examples: 
Eating an apple increases your saturation by 2,
eating a bread (from the farming mod) increases your saturation by 4.

Although it show 20 hunger points (10 breads) in hunger bar,
you can fill it up to 30 points.(5 breads not shown then)
